Config::KeyValue

I frequently need to share configuration information between /bin/sh, Perl 
and Ruby scripts.  While Perl and Ruby can easily support configuration files
in a variety of formats, shell scripts are more limited.  To work around that,
I've taken to defaulting to simple "KEY=VALUE" formatted configuration files.
These can be sourced by the shell scripts while also being easily interpreted
by Perl and Ruby.  This library is a Perl module for reading these simple
configuration files.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
